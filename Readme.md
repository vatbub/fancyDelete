# FancyDelete
> Delete files - but with style

Ever wanted to delete files with the same file name but different extensions?
My camera stores RAW and JPG images side by side with the same file name, but obviously with different file extensions.
Previously, when I had a photo that I wanted to delete, I had to delete both copies separately. 
Now, I assigned a single keyboard shortcut in my photo management tool which sends the file to fancyDelete which deletes all related files for me.

## Features
- User passes a file name and fancyDelete deletes all files in that folder with the same file name but different file extensions
